It also requires Lots and Lots of Details to make it work effectively.  Now that the New Longview School is Hosting the 100

Year anniversary of its beginning on May 2nd 2025,  I would like to make this Contribution as a Depository for all things the

Old Longview School was,  but I do need help and I am hoping for any Volunteers who know how to write HTML Code but also,

Anyone can contribute Materials related to the School such as Pictures or Videos or Stories or Audio.  For Example,  I thought

it would be fun for Someone to Recreate the Sound of the Morning Bell We heard everyday - Me for Eight Years!

This Project will never be Finished but at Least it is Started.  I have Lots of Material Myself and I Know from the Longview

FaceBook Page,  Other People have Material they Would Like to Contribute Too.  I would like this WebPage to be Artistic

and Dynamic and Interactive,  but That requires skill of the Language as well as time and effort I don't have all Myself.

Not only is this WebPage good for Storing Memories,  But it is also Possible to recreate the Old Longview School as a 

Physical Model as well as a Virtual Model.  I have Blueprints from the 1945 new Construction and there are Aerial Photos.
